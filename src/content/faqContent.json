      "question": "What's your refund policy?",
      "answer": "Since this is a digital product, I don't offer refunds. However, if you don't get any matches after 10 days of implementing my strategies, I'll provide email support to help you troubleshoot and improve your results. I'm committed to your success."
    },
    {
      "question": "What age range does this work for?",
      "answer": "I have worked with men aged between 18-55. The principles of expressing yourself and showing interest (which is what seduction is all about), are universal. However, I do provide age-specific advice and examples throughout the guide."
    },
    {
      "question": "How realistic do the AI photos look?",
      "answer": "My AI photos make you look slightly better than reality while maintaining authenticity. They enhance your best features without creating a false persona. The method I teach focuses on realistic, casual smartphone-style photos that look natural."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I create AI images?",
      "answer": "You'll need to do a small photoshoot at home with good lighting. The {{productName}} ebook includes detailed instructions on how to take the right photos and use AI tools to generate realistic, attractive images that represent your authentic self."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will the photos look realistic and not 'AI-ish'?",
      "answer": "Yes! My method specifically teaches you to create realistic, casual smartphone-style photos. I avoid the 'photoshoot-ish' look that screams 'AI generated.' The goal is photos that look like natural, everyday pictures you'd take yourself."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can dating apps detect AI photos?",
      "answer": "No, dating apps cannot detect AI-generated photos. The technology used by dating apps focuses on detecting fake accounts and spam, not AI-enhanced photos. My methods create photos that are indistinguishable from regular photos."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need a powerful computer?",
      "answer": "No, you don't need a powerful computer. The AI services I recommend run through websites, so you just need internet access. However, I recommend using a computer rather than a phone for ease of use and better results."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will I get banned for using AI photos?",
      "answer": "Dating apps don't explicitly ban AI photos, but they do require authenticity. My approach focuses on enhancing your authentic self rather than creating false personas. For reference, here are the official guidelines: Hinge Community Guidelines (https://hinge.co/community-guidelines), Tinder Community Guidelines (https://policies.tinder.com/community-guidelines), and Bumble Community Guidelines (https://bumble.com/community-guidelines). I teach ethical practices that align with these policies."
