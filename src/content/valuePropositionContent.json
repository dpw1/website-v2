    "I have been into the dating journey myself for almost two decades now. I have tried everything under the sun: pick up art, going to clubs, making friends and having them introduce me their girl-friends, becoming a musician and playing on stage often, etc. Some of these worked to a certain degree, but it was always a TON of work for very few/occasional results. It was frustrating.",
    "I had tried online dating a million times before with no avail. I used what I thought were good pictures, I was looking nice, but never had any good matches, or no matches at all. I even hired a pro photographer once and took some good pictures, not much luck either.",
    "Until I decided to go all in and actually work alongside a few photographers. I am ashamed to say how many pictures I tested and took, but finally after a few years I managed to have a decent profile of real pictures. The results were good enough.",
    "Until one day I came across this AI tech and, being a programmer as well, I was instantly curious. I decided to give it a go and started first with some AI editing: adding a jacket to a real picture I had, etc. This was working fine but things changed since I came across the technology I am going to show you in this book. This changed my dating life from pretty much overnight."

      "This is a paradox: it's the best and worst time in history to be with women.",
      "Best because there are tons of options and countless ways to get yourself in front of women. You can actually find someone nowadays who is a perfect match for your current situation, unlike a few decades ago when you would have only a handful of women available.",
      "Worst because: most people's attention span equals that of a goldfish, there is an illusion of \"if this person isn't perfect, I can go find 100 different ones, one of them will be perfect.\" & because it takes skill and understanding about online dating to actually get a woman's attention. It's not about just being handsome and having a few pictures anymore. This means that, regardless of how good your profile is, you will experience a lot of ghosting and immature people.",
      "In this ebook, I will teach you how to detect early on an immature woman who won't lead to anything and filter them out so you can save your time and sanity and actually be with women who are not just looking for validation, but looking for romance, sex, and/or adventure."
