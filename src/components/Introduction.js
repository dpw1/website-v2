          <p className="paragraph-text">This is my 12 years of experience with women, condensed into a practical guide to help any average man get more dates.</p>
          <p className="paragraph-text">I started this journey 12 years ago. Even during my childhood, I had a natural obsession with women: at 7 years old, I would buy gifts for the girls in my class.</p>
          <p className="paragraph-text">I have always been a skinny man (ranging between 125lb - 145lb) of average height (5'9), with acne for years. I'm not bad-looking, but I am not a model either: just an average man. Needless to say women were not interested at all in me.</p>
          <p className="paragraph-text">Still, I tried everything and eventually managed to live a life many would consider impossible unless you're 6+ feet, have a six-pack, are handsome and rich. Fortunately, this is a lie that I will happily debunk. It's not like having these things won't help: of course, being attractive and whatever makes things way easier. But being average and putting the right effort can get you even farther ahead of men naturally attractive.</p>
          <p className="paragraph-text">For all these years, I kept it a secret, and now I want to help others with what I learned the hard way. Years of loneliness, solitude, and sexual frustration-something I see many men in this day and age going through.</p>

            <p className="paragraph-text">Competitors will charge you more than the price of this book just to make a limited number of pictures that may not even work. I am giving you knowledge and <b>freedom</b>.</p>
            <p className="paragraph-text">In this book, you will learn how to create as many images as you want, as well as understand what type of pictures work.</p>
            <p className="paragraph-text">I will show you exactly how to make the images, as well as how to find the cheapest services online to generate AI images and the correct prompts to achieve the best results.</p>
            <p className="paragraph-text">It may sound contradictory, but the goal here is not necessarily having 'nice looking' pictures, but pictures that will ultimately land you real-life dates with women you're attracted to.</p>
