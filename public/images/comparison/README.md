# Comparison Images

The Comparison component requires three images to be placed in this directory:

1. **PawBoatSittingDrink_00004_.png** - Image for GetDates.ai card
2. **CGPT-carousel.png** - Image for Other AI Tools card  
3. **paw-headshot-7.jpeg** - Image for Dating Photographer card

## How to Download

Since these images are served through Next.js image optimization, you'll need to:

1. Visit https://aidatingphoto.com/ in your browser
2. Navigate to the comparison section ("Photos that actually look like you")
3. Right-click on each image and "Save image as..."
4. Save them to this directory with the exact filenames listed above

Alternatively, you can:
- Use browser developer tools to find the actual image URLs
- Use a browser extension like "Image Downloader" to batch download images
- Contact the website owner for the original image files

## Image Requirements

- **PawBoatSittingDrink_00004_.png**: Should be approximately 240x240px or larger
- **CGPT-carousel.png**: Should be approximately 240x240px or larger
- **paw-headshot-7.jpeg**: Should be approximately 240x240px or larger

The component will automatically resize and display these images correctly.
